# grab files with route labels from previous go through

# grab old plays file with information on whether the play was a pass/run/sack
# still not dealing with sacks since not worried about play success anymore, should be enough data points without it

# for plays that were runs get receiver route information and label them run routes

# combine run routes and pass routes

# create one database with column headers from thoughts.py

# create another database with all of the x y timestep points of the routes using the game Id, play Id, player iD info
# from above dataset
