# team coverage

# load in same lineStrings as individual_coverage_active_learning.R
# will just work with defense coverage guys and route runners
# on each picture I want name and position of defenders, name, position and route of offensive players, 
# maybe in white boxes to not be as cluttered

# load in individual coverages

# give specific gameId and playId

# parse datasets using dplyr to make sure only looking at current play

# get rows of defensive players in zone coverage

# classify if they are deep/ middle/ close zone based on median depth from los

# classify coverage # based on where safeties and cornerbacks are/ number of each in zone

# depict where zone players should be based on coverage # and webisites such as:
# https://thecollegefootballgirl.com/football-terms/advanced/coverage-schemes/

# draw man connecting line to closest receiver on average throughout play, blitz arrow, and zone where
# players should be with a line connecting player to center of zone.
